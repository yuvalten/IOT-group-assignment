Project Review:
Abstract-
Design and develop Python program that simulate Energy Meter module. 
The Energy Meter simulator will generate meter readings and will send the meter readings to a different process (mqtt broker) that will be describe below.
In the program you will also develop integrated environment for testing.  The program's input should be a schedule of meter readings. 
The program output will print the meter readings according to message receive time. 

Background
Relevant protocols
ProtoBuf (in this project you are required to use proto2) - https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/
MQTT - http://mqtt.org/
Json - (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data-interchange format. It is easy for humans to read and write. It is easy for machines to parse and generate.
